Things to know on Test Data:
Test data is actually the input given to a software program. It represents data that affects or is affected by the execution of the specific module. Some data may be used for positive testing, typically to verify that a given set of input to a given function produces an expected result. Other data may be used for negative testing to test the ability of the program to handle unusual, extreme, exceptional, or unexpected input. Poorly designed testing data may not test all possible test scenarios which will hamper the quality of the software. 

What is Test Data Generation? Why test data should be created before test execution?
Depending on your testing environment you may need to CREATE Test Data (Most of the times) or atleast identify a suitable test data for your test cases (is the test data is already created).

This tool helps users to generate random test data for testing a software application.
